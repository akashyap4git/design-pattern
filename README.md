Design patterns in Java are standard solutions to common software design problems. They provide a proven way to structure code for reusability, maintainability, and scalability. The major categories are:

1. Creational Patterns
These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.

Abstract Factory: Creates families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

Prototype: Creates new objects by cloning an existing object.


2. Structural Patterns
These deal with object composition or structure.

Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

Decorator: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.

Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

Composite: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Bridge: Decouples abstraction from its implementation.

Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Flyweight: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects.


3. Behavioral Patterns
These focus on communication between objects.

Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency, so when one object changes state, others are notified.

Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.

Command: Encapsulates a request as an object.

State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override steps.

Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.

Mediator: Reduces coupling between components by having them communicate through a mediator.

Visitor: Adds new operations to objects without modifying their structure.

Interpreter: Implements a grammar and interpreter for a language.


I have created examples on some of them taking same context example to understand better.

Weâ€™ll imagine a platform like "FoodNow" that lets users order food, apply discounts, track orders, and receive notifications. We'll reuse elements like:

Order

Customer

DeliveryService

DiscountStrategy

NotificationService

OrderStatus
